This is a "sneak preview" release of a bootable uClinux for
older Coldfire-based HP Deskjet printers.

Currently none of the motors or sensors are supported.  This
is just a proof-of-concept release.

Currently the only platform tested is the Deskjet 895cxi.

Note that this code is being developed without any documentation
on the hardware.  The current code does not attempt to drive any 
motors or devices, but even so there is a small chance it may 
damage the hardware, and one should be prepared to deal with 
unexpected movement or possibly even electrical burnouts, even
when running on the same series the kernel is compiled for,
since there is no assurance even identically numbered models
have the exact same components.

That said, there is a chance the binary image may work on a few
models close to the 895cxi in lineage.  Note that a USB port
is currently needed for shell access.


==================================
Test-driving the binary image:
==================================

Required: minicom, srecord, parallel port, usb 1.0 port + gserial.

To boot the binary image, simply attach both the parallel port and
the USB port, cycle the power on the dj895c with both buttons held down
until all 3 LEDs come on, and do the following:

modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0525 product=0xA4A6
sleep 1
cat image.srec > /dev/lp0

...assuming your parallel port is lp0.  Then run minicom on 
/dev/ttyUSB0 (assuming you have no other USB serial ports) and wait 
for a login prompt.

==================================
Building from source
==================================

o Apply the patch to dist-20091129
o make menuconfig; defaults should suffice
o mkdir romfs
o make
o make again to get the romfs into the kernel's ramfs
o Remember to cycle the printer power and hold the buttons
o Use the runkernel script from vendors/HP/DJ895c.

==================================
Parallel console messages
==================================

There's a read-only hack to see console messages.
Search for "p1284" in kernel/printk.c, and uncomment
that line before building.

Build the pphack.c file from inside vendors/HP/DJ895c.
But first, adjust it to use the IO ports for your parallel 
port.

Uncomment the line that calls pphack in the runkernel 
script from vendors/HP/DJ895c.

You must leave the parallel port plugged in or the 
kernel will halt.

A parallel console usable with ptal-mlcd will hopefully
be ready by the next preview release.
